# Pizza Shop Mini Lab

Spend around 30 mins looking at the provided end code for the pizza shop.

## To help you figure things out you could -

* Write in detail the path followed through the app for creating a pizza order. eg: "user triggers post, then..."
* Draw a simple diagram on how you understand the request + response cycle and other steps involved. This diagram doesn't need to be beautiful or perfect, we just want you to explore the flow of information through MVC.
* Investigate how `redirect to` works in Sinatra. What's the browser's role in this?
* Examine the edit and new forms, they are similar, but different in a couple of significant ways - **why are they different**?
* Add some breakpoints (`binding.pry`) where you're not sure how things are working
